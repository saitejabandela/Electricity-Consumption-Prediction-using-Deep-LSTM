# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the initial phase of the project, I conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the electricity consumption dataset. This EDA process helped me understand patterns, trends, and potential factors affecting electricity consumption.

# LSTM Model Development
The core of this project lies in the development of a Deep LSTM model for electricity consumption prediction. The model leverages the power of deep learning to provide accurate forecasts. Key steps in the model development process include:

**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the data.
**Model Architecture**: Designing a Deep LSTM network with suitable layers and parameters.
**Training**: Training the model on historical data, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and ensuring convergence.
**Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAPE.
**Model Validation**: Rigorous model validation to ensure generalization and reliability.
